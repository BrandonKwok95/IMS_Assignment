## Environment Setup
### 1. This assginment is based on MAC OS X 15.4
### 2. Necessary tools:
                    a. Jupyter (python 3.7)
                            (1) os
                            (3) json

       all the source videos are from https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/

## Implementation
### 1. After finished environment setup, run CreateFolder.ipynb to create folder (setup frame)
### 2. After ensuring all folders have been setup, run Encoding.ipynb to encode source video

## Result
### The implement reulst is in vmaf folder(video quality), video-format(file-size / bit-rate),  encode-video(encoded videos)
